## About the Project
**Motivation**: Explain why you built this project and any specific problem it solves.

**Overview**: Briefly outline what this project does, how it stands out, and any unique approaches or techniques used.

Use Cases:
    - Example 1
    - Example 2

##  Key Features

Core Storage Layer

Create a basic key-value store interface with Get, Put, Delete, and Exists methods.
Store data in-memory, with possible options for disk persistence (e.g., using boltDB).

Sharding and Partitioning
Implement consistent hashing to distribute keys across different nodes.
Set up a partitioning function that assigns data keys to specific nodes based on hash ranges.
Replication
Each partition should be replicated across multiple nodes for redundancy.
Use a leader-follower model where each partition has a leader that handles writes and multiple followers for read replicas.
Implement a replication protocol (e.g., primary-backup, or quorum-based).

Fault Tolerance
Handle node failures by redistributing data across surviving nodes.
Implement heartbeats and failure detection.
Add leader election using Raft or another consensus protocol to ensure a replica can take over in case of leader failure.

Client Interface
Design a client library to interact with the key-value store, with methods for Put, Get, Delete, and batch operations.
Include a retry mechanism for fault tolerance and redirection to new leaders when a leader node fails.

Networking
Set up communication between nodes using gRPC or a lightweight HTTP server for efficient message-passing.
Include protocols for replication, sharding, and heartbeats for fault detection.

**Concurrency Patterns**
  - Use Goâ€™s goroutines and channels to handle concurrent requests and replication.
  - Implement advanced concurrency mechanisms, such as worker pools, to handle high throughput.

**KVStore - core storage layer**
  - Hybrid storage support: In-Memory and Disk Persistence
  - Use LSM tree to model data
  - TTL Support
  - Batching and Atomic Operations support
  - Snapshotting for Faster Recovery
  - Concurrency Control with Optimistic Locking

**Sharding layer**

**Replication layer**
  - Implement heartbeats
  - Failure detection
  - Leader election using Raft
    
## Getting Started

### Installing
To start using NexusDB, install Go 1.23 or above. NexusDB needs go modules. From your project, run the following command

```sh
$ go get github.com/imariom/nexusdb
```
This will retrieve the library.

#### Installing NexusDB Command Line Tool

NexusDB provides a CLI tool which can perform certain operations like offline backup/restore.  To install the NexusDB CLI,
retrieve the repository and checkout the desired version.  Then run

```sh
$ cd nexusc
$ go install .
```
This will install the NexusDB command line utility into your $GOBIN path.

## Tech Stack
**Languages**: Python, JavaScript, etc.
**Frameworks**: Django, React, Flask, etc.
**Libraries/Tools**: BeautifulSoup, TensorFlow, Docker, etc.
